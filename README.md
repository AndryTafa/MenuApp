This project is a restaurant kiosk application developed using Kotlin and Java. It is designed to provide a seamless and efficient ordering experience for customers.

**Technologies Used**
**Kotlin**: The primary language used for developing the application. Kotlin is a modern, expressive, and safe language for Android development.

**Hilt**: A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in the project.

**Coroutines**: Used for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing the need for callbacks.

**LiveData**: An observable data holder class that is lifecycle-aware. This means it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.

**ViewModel**: Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

**Features**
**Category Selection**: Users can select a category of food they are interested in.

**Food Selection**: Users can select the food they want to order from the selected category.

**Cart Management**: Users can add food to the cart, increase or decrease the quantity of the food in the cart, and remove food from the cart.

**Total Cost Calculation**: The application calculates the total cost of the food in the cart.
